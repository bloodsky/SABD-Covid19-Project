## Developed by: [Pavia Roberto](https://github.com/bloodsky)

Main repository for analyzing covid19 data taken from [here](https://github.com/italia/covid19-opendata-vaccini)
The project is divided into modules and each of these has been developed in a separate repository from this one. 
In this way, parallel development of the different parts of the application is possible (Data Ingestion, Analysis, Consume)
