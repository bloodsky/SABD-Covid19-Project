# SABD-Covid19-Project

## Developed by: [Pavia Roberto](https://github.com/bloodsky)

Main repository written in Scala (Spark Core analysis) made to study covid19 data taken from [here](https://github.com/italia/covid19-opendata-vaccini).    
The project is divided into modules and each of these has been developed in a separate repository from this one. 
In this way, parallel development of the different parts of the application is possible (Data Ingestion, Analysis, Consume).  
More details in the [documentation](https://github.com/bloodsky/SABD-Covid19-Project/blob/master/SABD_COVID19_DOCUMENTATION.pdf).
